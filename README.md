 Convert from English to Groot language, Groot is a Flora colossus from Planet X, the capital of the branch
 worlds. The Flora colossi are tree-like beings whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the
 stiffness of their larynxes, causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase "I am Groot".
